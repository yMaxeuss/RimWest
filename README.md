  This mod incorporates elements from [SYR] Processor Framework but has been modified to better fit the needs of this mod. Full credit to [SYR] for their original work.

  All other coding and artwork were created by me.

  Right now, I'm out of ideas for upcoming updates, so feel free to share any suggestions, bug reports, or features you'd like to see in future updates in the comments below. However, I won’t be adding any apparel or new factions, as there are already plenty of mods available for it, and I'm not very good at apparel art.
